  # Kubelet image GC. imageMaximumGCAge is a KubeletConfiguration-only field —
  # it was never registered as a --kubelet-arg CLI flag, so it must come from a
  # config file (passed via --kubelet-arg config=). The disk-pressure thresholds
  # and min age could still be flags, but keeping all four here avoids mixing
  # mechanisms and dodges the deprecated-flag warnings. No featureGates entry:
  # ImageMaximumGCAge is GA and on by default as of k8s 1.34 (we run 1.35).
  # Graceful node shutdown: kubelet takes a logind delay-inhibitor and drains
  # pods in priority order before the box powers off — ordinary pods first (which
  # unmounts their CephFS CSI volumes while the Rook mons/OSDs are still up), then
  # system-node-critical pods (the OSDs/CSI plugins) in the final window. This is
  # what breaks the shutdown-hang deadlock where the kernel CephFS mount outlives
  # the OSD pods backing it. Kubelet clamps shutdownGracePeriod to logind's
  # InhibitDelayMaxSec, so that's raised to match below. GracefulNodeShutdown is
  # beta/default-on since k8s 1.21, so no featureGates entry is needed.
