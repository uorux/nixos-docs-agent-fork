# Off-site backups to MEGA S4 (S3-compatible object storage). Two independent
# jobs, both additive to backups.nix (borgmatic→borgbase still covers /persist;
# btrbk still does local snapshots) — this file is what gets the bcachefs pool
# and Garage's real data off-site, since neither has any other off-host copy
# (garage runs replication_factor = 1).
#
# ── restic → S4 bucket `recusant-restic` ─────────────────────────────────────
# Filesystem paths on the bcachefs pool:
#   /mnt/bcachefs/k8s/Immich   — the Immich library (k8s mounts it over NFS)
#   /mnt/bcachefs/backups      — staging dir; other hosts will later deposit
#                                their backups here and reach S4 "for free"
# restic gives client-side encryption + deduped snapshot history with
# forget/prune retention, so this leg has real versioning.
#
# ── rclone S3→S3 → S4 bucket `recusant-garage` ───────────────────────────────
# Mirrors the k8s-tenant Garage buckets (velero, cnpg-backups, gitea-rgw) —
# deliberately NOT nix-cache, which is a regenerable attic binary cache sharing
# the same Garage instance. This content is sensitive (cnpg WAL = full DB
# contents, velero backups can include k8s Secrets, gitea-rgw = repo data), so
# it goes through an rclone `crypt` wrapper remote: contents AND names are
# encrypted client-side (NaCl secretbox) before MEGA sees them — the S4-side
# bucket is opaque, and restore requires rclone + the crypt passwords from the
# sops env (obscured form; `rclone reveal` recovers the plaintext — the
# encrypted env file in git is the recovery copy). Logical layout per source
# bucket (physical names on S4 are encrypted):
#   recusant-garage/<bucket>/current/       — the mirror
#   recusant-garage/<bucket>/archive/DATE/  — history: any object a sync would
#                                             overwrite or delete is MOVED here
#                                             (--backup-dir), pruned after 90d
# Crypt trade-off: no MD5/ETag passthrough, so syncs compare size+modtime
# instead of checksums (fine — this data is write-once with unique names) and
# a full integrity re-verify needs `rclone check --download` (egress).
# Chosen over provider bucket-versioning: --backup-dir is provider-agnostic
# (S4's versioning/lifecycle support is undocumented), prunable with one flag,
# and restore is a plain copy. For append-mostly buckets (velero, cnpg WAL)
# the archive holds whatever their own retention deletes for another 90 days;
# for mutable gitea-rgw it's per-day object revisions. NOTE the flip side: if
# a Garage bucket is ever wiped, the next sync moves EVERYTHING into that
# day's archive — the 90-day window is the undo.
#
# ── One-time bootstrap ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   1. MEGA S4 console — confirm the region first! rclone knows the
#      current-style endpoints (s3.ca-vancouver.megas4.com; legacy alias
#      s3.ca-west-1.s4.mega.io) — use whichever the console shows, and fix
#      s4Endpoint below if it differs. Then:
#        - create buckets: recusant-restic, recusant-garage
#        - create access key(s). Do NOT enable bucket versioning — history is
#          restic's / --backup-dir's job, provider versions would just grow
#          unpruned.
#   2. Garage (on recusant; buckets already exist, wired from k8s) — mint one
#      read-only sync key (read = list+get, all a sync source needs; the k8s
#      writers keep their own rw keys per the garage.nix tenancy model):
#        garage key create backup-sync-ro     # note Key ID + Secret
#        garage bucket allow --read velero       --key backup-sync-ro
#        garage bucket allow --read cnpg-backups --key backup-sync-ro
#        garage bucket allow --read gitea-rgw    --key backup-sync-ro
#   3. Secrets. secrets/s4-backups.yaml already holds a generated
#      restic-s4-password (the encrypted file in git IS the recovery copy —
#      decryptable via the recusant/galaxy/constitution host keys) and a
#      restic-s4-repo of s3:https://s3.ca-vancouver.megas4.com/recusant-restic;
#      edit the repo URL only if the console region differs (step 1).
#      secrets/s4-backups.env already holds generated crypt passwords
#      (RCLONE_CONFIG_S4CRYPT_PASSWORD/PASSWORD2, rclone-obscured — same
#      recovery model; NEVER rotate these once data is uploaded or the mirror
#      becomes unreadable). Fill its CHANGE_ME placeholders with the real keys:
#        sops nixos/hosts/recusant/secrets/s4-backups.env
#          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<S4 key id, restic>
#          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<S4 secret, restic>
#          RCLONE_CONFIG_GARAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<backup-sync-ro key id>
#          RCLONE_CONFIG_GARAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<backup-sync-ro secret>
#          RCLONE_CONFIG_S4_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<S4 key id, rclone>
#          RCLONE_CONFIG_S4_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<S4 secret, rclone>
#      (restic's and rclone's S4 credentials are separate vars even if they
#      start as the same key, so they can be rotated/scoped independently.)
#   4. Rebuild, then first runs by hand:
#        systemctl start restic-backups-s4.service   # slow: full Immich upload
#        systemctl start rclone-garage-s4.service
#      Verify: restic-s4 snapshots      (module wrapper on PATH, run as root)

  # enters `failed`, which the k8s Prometheus systemd-unit alerting already scrapes
  # off recusant's node-exporter — so a broken/undecryptable/empty repo pages
  # instead of being discovered the day it's needed. Two checks:
  #   1. snapshots exist (catches a backup that silently stopped landing);
