# Attic — self-hosted Nix binary cache, backed by the local Garage S3.
#
# Purpose (current scope: CI only): the self-hosted runners on the arquitens
# k3s cluster build our NixOS configs / custom packages, and PUSH+PULL the
# closures here via attic-action so CI runs reuse prebuilt paths. The cache is
# PRIVATE (token-gated reads) — runners authenticate per-job with a token, so it
# is never made --public. Fleet-wide pulling (workstations pulling as a plain
# substituter) is intentionally NOT wired yet; that would need a pull token
# distributed to each host (sops is currently only set up on recusant).
#
# Shape (mirrors agent-auth.nix): native NixOS service on recusant, listening on
# loopback, fronted by nginx on the tailscale IP under the *.recusant.rooty.dev
# wildcard cert. Runners reach it over the tailnet exactly like they reach the
# k3s API. Storage is the `nix-cache` Garage bucket (see garage.nix); Attic talks
# to Garage over the tailnet-bound S3 API. Secrets (RS256 signing key + S3
# access key) come from a sops env file, never the store.
#
# ── One-time bootstrap ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   1. Do the Garage bootstrap in garage.nix first (bucket `nix-cache` + key
#      `attic-rw`). Note the key's Key ID + Secret.
#   2. Generate the RS256 signing secret and fill the sops env file:
#        nix shell nixpkgs#sops nixpkgs#openssl
#        openssl genrsa -traditional 4096 | base64 -w0    # -> RS256 secret
#        sops nixos/hosts/recusant/secrets/atticd.env
#          ATTIC_SERVER_TOKEN_RS256_SECRET_BASE64=<the base64 above>
#          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<attic-rw Key ID>
#          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<attic-rw Secret>
#   3. Rebuild recusant. Mint a CI push token (scoped push+pull to nix-cache):
#        atticd-atticadm make-token --sub ci --validity '10y' \
#          --pull nix-cache --push nix-cache
#      Store that token as a GitHub Actions secret (route it through agent-auth's
#      secret flow rather than pasting by hand).
#   4. From a workstation, create the (private) cache:
#        attic login recusant https://attic.recusant.rooty.dev <admin-token>
#        attic cache create nix-cache
#      Leave it private — do NOT `attic cache configure nix-cache --public`.
#      `attic cache info nix-cache` prints the public signing key; you only need
#      it if you later wire fleet-wide substituter pulls (not done today — see
#      the purpose note above). CI uses the push token from step 3 via
#      attic-action, which configures the substituter + netrc inside each job.
