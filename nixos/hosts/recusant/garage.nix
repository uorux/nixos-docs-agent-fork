# Garage — single-node S3, shared by multiple tenants on this host.
#
# Tenancy model: one bucket per purpose, one access key per purpose, each key
# scoped read+write to ONLY its bucket. A leaked Attic push token can never
# touch backups, and vice versa. Buckets:
#   nix-cache     — Attic binary cache backend (key: attic-rw)     [in use]
#   velero        — k3s cluster backups (velero)                   [in use]
#   cnpg-backups  — k3s CloudNativePG WAL/base backups             [in use]
#   gitea-rgw     — k3s Gitea object storage                       [in use]
# The three k8s buckets are mirrored off-site to MEGA S4 with a read-only
# key (backup-sync-ro) — see s4-backups.nix.
#
# Exposure: the S3 API binds recusant's tailscale IP so both the local Attic
# server AND the k8s backup tenant on arquitens can reach it over the tailnet.
# tailscale0 is globally trusted (networking.nix), so nothing is opened to the
# LAN/WAN — no allowedTCPPorts needed. RPC/admin stay on loopback (single node,
# no remote consumer). An nginx vhost (bottom of this file) also fronts the S3
# API at https://garage.recusant.rooty.dev for a TLS endpoint with a stable
# hostname — still tailnet-only (nginx binds the tailscale IP).
#
# Durability note: replication_factor = 1 means no redundancy on the node
# itself. Fine for the regenerable nix-cache; the k8s buckets get their
# off-host copy via the daily rclone mirror to MEGA S4 (s4-backups.nix).
#
# The GARAGE_RPC_SECRET is sops-managed (secrets/garage.env) and read via
# systemd EnvironmentFile — no manual /persist file, so a rebuild alone brings
# Garage up. (EnvironmentFile is loaded by root before the DynamicUser drop, so
# the 0400 root secret is fine.)
#
# ── One-time bootstrap on recusant (after first rebuild with enable = true) ───
#   1. Layout (single node claims all capacity):
#        garage layout assign -z dc1 -c 1T <node-id-from `garage status`>
#        garage layout apply --version 1
#   2. nix-cache bucket + scoped key (feed the key into secrets/atticd.env):
#        garage bucket create nix-cache
#        garage key create attic-rw          # note the Key ID + Secret
#        garage bucket allow --read --write nix-cache --key attic-rw
#   3. Per-tenant buckets (velero/cnpg-backups/gitea-rgw) follow the same shape:
#        garage bucket create <bucket>
#        garage key create <tenant>-rw
#        garage bucket allow --read --write <bucket> --key <tenant>-rw
#      (Off-site mirroring of these adds a read-only key — see s4-backups.nix.)

  # ── TLS S3 endpoint ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # A friendly, TLS-terminated front for the S3 API. The raw API already answers
  # on the tailnet at ${tailscaleIp}:3900 (plaintext), which is how local Attic
  # and the arquitens backup tenant reach it. This vhost adds an HTTPS endpoint —
  # `garage.recusant.rooty.dev` — under the existing *.recusant.rooty.dev wildcard
  # cert (secrets.nix), so S3 clients can use a stable hostname with TLS instead
  # of a bare tailscale IP. Same shape as attic.nix / agent-auth.nix: nginx binds
  # the tailscale IP (server_name-matches within that exact-address socket), so
  # nothing is opened to LAN/WAN — reachable only over the tailnet.
  #
  # Path-style addressing: clients must NOT use virtual-hosted-style buckets
  # (bucket.garage.recusant.rooty.dev), since neither the wildcard cert nor this
  # vhost covers that extra label and Garage has no root_domain set. Point the S3
  # client at https://garage.recusant.rooty.dev with force_path_style = true.
