# systemd-stash backend — the app's private data lives in a root-owned stash
# (/persist/sandbox/<app>, 0700 root: the per-app LOCK). A static per-app system
# service runs, as its single ExecStart (`+` = full privileges),
# `unshare --mount … runScript`, which:
#   1. gets a fresh private, non-propagating mount namespace (from unshare),
#   2. as root grafts each stash leaf onto its ~/path via `mount --bind` — root
#      traverses the 0700 lock; the graft stays private to this ns,
#   3. setpriv-drops to the app principal and execs the inner bwrap wrapper.
# One invocation: systemd applies namespacing per-Exec, so a mount in ExecStartPre
# would be gone by ExecStart.
#
# TWO isolation modes (sandbox.dedicatedUser):
#   - same-uid (default): drops to jrt. Hides the stash from OTHER SANDBOXED apps
#     (their pid/mount ns) but NOT from an unsandboxed jrt shell (/proc/<pid>/root
#     is same-uid → readable). Good for app-to-app lateral-movement.
#   - dedicated: drops to a per-app `app-<name>` uid. A uid mismatch DAC-denies jrt
#     both the leaf AND /proc/<pid>/root (+ ptrace of its memory) — this is what
#     stops a compromised (non-root) jrt from reaching the app. It also fixes a
#     dedicated-only injection vector: jrt must NOT feed the app a jrt-writable env
#     file (LD_PRELOAD → code exec as app-<name>), so dedicated uses a Nix-derived
#     env only. Cross-uid GUI access to jrt's session sockets is granted just-in-
#     time by the in-session launcher via ACLs.
#   (Neither stops a ROOT-level host escape — that's the microVM tier.)
